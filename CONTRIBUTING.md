Just some light guidelines:
* No Discord (or other chat) servers - There are a million of them. Likewise for forums. Websites that *have* a forum or a server associated with them are perfectly fine, as long as the website is not only a means of having people join a forum/server.
* No chat bots - They're trivially easy to make, and there are tons of them. Exceptions might be made for bots above a certain user count; haven't decided yet.
* No CMTool mods - There are a million of them.
* No TexTools mods - See above. Exceptions might be made for UI mods.

"Cheating" software will be added at my own discretion; what crosses that line will be decided somewhat arbitrarily.
